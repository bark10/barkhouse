This mod consist of various blocks, items and other features that we come up with and implement on the [Barkhouse Survival Server](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=14957). Feel free to pick it apart and use just the parts you need.

I will eventually make this into a modpack, so that it will be easier to take out and use only the parts you are interested in.

__0.1.15__
* Added _Ironstone Cobble_ that is dropped when mining _Iron Stone_ (depends on [moreblocks](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=509) by Calinou) (ironstone cobble texture by Gold).
* Added Smoked Glass and _Smoked Glass Fragments_ for that tinted glass look. Recipe: vessels:glass_fragments + moreblocks:coal_dust = barkhouse:smoked_glass_fragments. This is then burned in furnace to create barkhouse:smoked_glass.
