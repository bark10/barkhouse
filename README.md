A humble mod put together mostly by me.
thefamilygrog66 helped coding the Lottery Block.

This mod consist of ideas that we come up with and implement on the Barkhouse server. Feel free to pick it apart and use just the parts you need.

================================
## Changelog
__0.1.5__
* Added _ironstone_cobble_ that is dropped when mining _moreblocks:iron_stone_ (depends on [moreblocks](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=509) by Calinou) (ironstone cobble texture by Gold).
* Added Smoked Glass and _Smoked Glass Fragments_ for that tinted glass look. Recipe: vessels:glass_fragments + moreblocks:coal_dust = barkhouse:smoked_glass_fragments. This is then burned in furnace to create barkhouse:smoked_glass

__0.1.4__
* Added Cobble Brick and Weathered Cobble Brick (textures by Gold)

__0.1.3__
* Added toilets, showers and sinks from tonyka's [3dFurniture](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=2207)
* Added Powered Torch - a brighter torch.

================================

* Plaster block - A block for that modern building look. Crafted by combining Anhydrite with water. one bucket yields 10 blocks.

* Graywood, Light Graywood and Dark Graywood - When steel wool is soaked in vinegar until the steel wool has been completely dissolved, this can be applied to wood to make it look aged. This mod makes wood, pinewood and birchwood into three gray plank types. Planning to improve the textures for these later.
