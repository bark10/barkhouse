A humble mod put together mostly by me.
thefamilygrog66 helped coding the Lottery Block.

This mod consist of ideas that we come up with and implement on the Barkhouse server. Feel free to pick it apart and use just the parts you need.

Code: GNU LGPL 2.1
wardrobe texture: WTFPL, from prestidigitator's wardrobe mod)
All other textures by bark: CC-BY-SA 3.0

*** Blocks ***
* Lottery Block - Participate to win fabolous prizes. Costs 1 Golden Coin to play.
* Plaster block - A block for that modern building look. Crafted by combining Anhydrite with water. one bucket yields 10 blocks.
* Iron Bar Floor - Put lava under it!
* Graywood, Light Graywood and Dark Graywood - When steel wool is soaked in vinegar until the steel wool has been completely dissolved, this can be applied to wood to make it look aged. This mod makes wood, pinewood and birchwood into three gray plank types. I might improve the textures for these later.
* Fluorescent dirt, fluorescent dirt-with-grass, fluorescent tree, fluorescent water, fluorescent leaves. Because flurescent stuff is nice. Might add more of these later.
* Wardrobe (decorative only).

*** Items ***

* Salt Fragments - Crafted from Salt Crystal (depends caverealms mod). Used to craft Anhydrite.
